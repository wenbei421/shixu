# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Android device and emulator support via ADB from Linux or macOS. Each plugin
  instance uses an abstract socket named `tauri-pilot-{identifier}-{random}.sock`,
  forwarded with `adb forward localfilesystem:... localabstract:...`. Connections
  require matching UID/GID pairs for the app, root or ADB shell. [#145]

- iOS Simulator support. A Simulator shares the Mac's filesystem, so the usual
  socket file is already reachable and the CLI needs no extra flags. Physical
  devices are not supported yet.

### Changed

- A bridge command on a page whose origin never said hello no longer runs its
  script before it fails, so a `click` there no longer clicks. `navigate` still
  runs, since it is the way back to the app origin.

### Fixed

- `storage get` on a missing key now exits 1, like `assert` and `wait`, so
  `storage get key || echo absent` works and a missing key is no longer
  confused with a key holding an empty string. The `(not found)` notice moved
  to stderr, leaving stdout for the value. `--json` still prints
  `{"found": false}` and exits 1 too. The JSON-RPC and MCP responses are
  unchanged. [#160]

- `wait --gone` now returns `{ gone: true }` (`--json`, MCP, JSON-RPC;
  CLI text: `✓ gone`) and times out with
  `Timeout waiting for <selector> to disappear`. Success used to
  return `{ found: true }` (CLI: `✓ found`) and the timeout said
  `Timeout waiting for <selector>`, both of which describe the
  opposite of waiting for an element to disappear. Callers that
  parsed `found` on the gone path must switch to `gone`. [#159]

- `value` and `snapshot` now report every selected option of a
  `<select multiple>`, joined with `", "` like the `forms` CLI
  (`skills = "rust, js"`). Both used `HTMLSelectElement.value`, which is
  only the first selected option, so a multi-select with `rust` and `js`
  selected looked like `rust`. `forms.dump` still returns the JSON array.
  [#158]

- `scroll --ref` now accepts a CSS selector or `x,y` coordinates, not only a
  snapshot ref. The bridge used `requireEl`, which looks the value up in the
  snapshot map, so `scroll down 50 --ref "#log"` raised `Unknown ref: #log`.
  Scroll now uses `resolveTarget` like click/fill/text, the CLI parses
  `--target` / `--ref` through `parse_target`, and MCP plus TOML scenario
  steps follow the same shapes. `--ref` remains an alias of `--target`.
  Bare snapshot ids (`e12`) still count as refs. [#157]

- `network` no longer records the plugin's own `__callback` IPC. Eval and
  the bridge hello POST to `ipc://localhost/plugin:pilot|__callback` (URL
  encoded). Fetch skipped that only when `URL.pathname` was exactly
  `/plugin:pilot|__callback`, which WebKit does not produce for the `ipc:`
  scheme, and XHR was never skipped. The skip now matches Tauri's IPC URL
  shapes on both fetch and XHR. [#156]

- `snapshot` and `snapshot -i` now list div-based interactive elements.
  Hosts with `draggable="true"`, `contenteditable`, an `onclick` attribute or
  property, or `tabindex` were dropped because `ROLE_MAP` has no `DIV` entry,
  so `walk()` emitted no ref. `isInteractiveElement` also ignored draggable,
  contenteditable, and `onclick`; a `tabindex` host was already treated as
  interactive. They now get a ref (`textbox` for contenteditable, `generic`
  otherwise). Layout wrappers without those signals stay out of the tree,
  as do unmapped hosts whose only signal is `tabindex < 0`. [#155]

- `fill`, `type`, and `check` no longer report ok on an element that cannot
  take the write. Assigning `.value` or `.checked` on a plain `<div>` created
  an expando and left the visible text unchanged, which is the same silent
  no-op `select` was hardened against. `fill` accepts `<input>`,
  `<textarea>`, `<select>`, and contenteditable hosts (including Tiptap /
  ProseMirror-style editors, via `insertText` with a `textContent`
  fallback). `fill` on `<select>` matches an option by value then label and
  throws if none match. `type` accepts `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and
  contenteditable hosts, and rejects `<select>` (use `fill` or `select`).
  Both throw on anything else. `check` accepts only checkbox and radio
  inputs. [#154]

- Without `--window` and without a `main` window, commands now target the
  first window by label, and `windows.list` sorts by label. Both used Tauri's
  hash order, which changes from run to run.

- `press` without `--window` now fails when the app has no webview window,
  instead of sending the key to whatever app has focus.

- `navigate` to an origin the pilot bridge cannot answer from no longer
  reports ok and leaves the session hung. The bridge does run on a foreign
  page, but Tauri's ACL rejects its `__callback` because the pilot permission
  only covers the app origin, so every later command waited out the 10 s eval
  timeout. The bridge now says hello through `__callback` on each page load,
  which tells the plugin which origins can answer. On a first visit, `navigate`
  waits up to 3 s for that hello and fails without it; a destination that
  already said hello waits the usual 10 s for the new page. Other commands on
  a page with no hello fail at once, and the error names the page and the
  origins that work. Navigating back to the app origin recovers the session,
  and an origin listed in a capability's `remote.urls` keeps working. Pilot's
  own IPC calls also no longer show up in `network.getRequests`. [#153]

- A second instance of an app that embeds the plugin no longer panics at
  startup. On Unix the plugin `setup` hook propagated the `AddrInUse` error
  from the socket bind, which Tauri turns into a fatal `PluginInitialization`
  error, so the second process died before it showed a window. The plugin is
  debug-only tooling: it now logs a warning, skips the server and lets the app
  run, which is what Windows already did. [#152]

- `screenshot_native` errors now carry their detail to the terminal. Every RPC
  error went through one `bail!` in the CLI client that kept the code and the
  message and dropped `error.data`, so a `WINDOW_NOT_FOUND` printed nothing of
  the `available_windows` list the plugin builds for it. The fix is in the
  shared error path, so any command whose plugin side attaches structured data
  keeps it. The plugin mirrors `message` into `data`, and the CLI drops that
  key only when it is the exact duplicate, so a producer with a distinct
  `data.message` still prints it. [#149]

- `screenshot_native` no longer reports a made-up `scale_factor`. The value was
  the captured PNG's pixel width divided by the window's logical width, which
  only holds when the PNG is the window. It comes from both axes now and is
  `null` when they disagree on the ratio: with screen recording denied the
  `CGWindowList` fallback returns a screen-sized image (2.87 across against
  2.79 down on a 2.0 display), and the permitted path was off too because
  `screencapture` padded its own PNG with the window's drop shadow. The
  `tcc_denied` flag no longer gates the derivation — it reports a permission
  state, and `capture_with_fallback` raises it after a granted probe whose
  per-window capture failed for some other reason. Two agreeing ratios are not
  proof by themselves, since a screen-sized image whose aspect happens to match
  the window's would pass, so the capture's provenance gates them: a
  `CGWindowList` PNG asks for `kCGWindowImageNominalResolution` and can only
  legitimately be 1:1, and anything else from that backend gets no scale.
  [#149]

- `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` passes again. The new
  `manual_is_variant_and` lint rejects the `.ok().is_some_and(...)` in
  `dangerous_mcp_tools_enabled`; it reads `.is_ok_and(...)` now, same
  behaviour.

- `screenshot` no longer pins the webview for minutes on style-variable-heavy
  pages. html-to-image copies computed styles onto the clone, and whenever
  `getComputedStyle(el).cssText` is empty — WebKit and Blink both — it falls
  back to one `setProperty` per name in `getComputedStyle(documentElement)`.
  On a Tailwind v4 page that is ~2200 names, ~1760 of them custom properties,
  applied to every cloned element; macOS WebKit re-serializes the whole style
  attribute on each call, making the clone quadratic (~370 s and 100 % CPU on a
  648-node page, with every later bridge call timing out until it finished).
  The bridge now passes a curated `includeStyleProperties` list of the
  properties a page actually paints, so the copy drops from ~2200 to 187
  `setProperty` calls per element (measured 28x faster end-to-end on a Chromium
  repro of that page at the original 156-name cut, pixel-identical output).
  Custom properties are dropped on purpose: computed values already arrive with
  their `var()` resolved. The list is an allowlist, though, so a standard
  painted property that is not on it is missing from the capture as well;
  on macOS `screenshot_native` remains the pixel-exact escape hatch. [#146]

### Changed

- Dependency floors raised in `Cargo.toml`, the only pinning this repo commits
  (`Cargo.lock` is ignored, so a requirement is what actually reaches a
  consumer): `anyhow` 1 -> 1.0.104, `libc` 0.2.184 -> 0.2.189 in both crates,
  `owo-colors` 4.3.0 -> 4.4.0, `rmcp` 3.1.4 -> 3.2.0, and the `tauri-plugin`
  build dependency 2.6.1 -> 2.6.3. The `anyhow` floor is the one that matters:
  it clears RUSTSEC-2026-0190, an unsoundness in `Error::downcast_mut()`
  patched in 1.0.103.

- macOS native captures no longer include the window's drop shadow.
  `capture_screencapture` passes `screencapture -o`, so the PNG matches
  `kCGWindowBounds` and the scale factor is derivable from it. [#149]

### Security

- `available_windows`, returned with a `WINDOW_NOT_FOUND` error, no longer
  carries the titles of windows owned by other processes. The list walks every
  on-screen window, and now that the CLI renders `error.data` that payload
  reaches stderr and the MCP client, so one stale `--window-id` would have
  handed a developer's document names, URLs and chat titles to whatever model
  backs that client. `window_id` and `owner` are what a caller needs to
  retarget. [#149]

## [0.7.3] - 2026-08-30

### Changed

- Upgrade `rmcp` to 3.1.4 (from 1.7). The only break reaching this codebase is
  SEP-2322: `ServerHandler::call_tool` now returns `CallToolResponse`, converted
  at the trait boundary so the internal helpers keep returning `CallToolResult`.
  The MCP tool surface is unchanged. `base64` 0.23, `windows` 0.62,
  `core-graphics` 0.25 and `serial_test` 4 move with it. [#143]

### Fixed

- `drag` now performs a real pointer gesture, so it drives JS drag libraries
  (dnd-kit, sortable.js, interact.js, react-dnd's mouse backend) instead of only
  HTML5 `draggable="true"` handlers. Previously it dispatched HTML5 DragEvents
  plus a single `mousedown` — no `mousemove` stream and no `mouseup` — which those
  libraries cannot activate on, while still returning `ok: true`. A drag against a
  dnd-kit app therefore reported success and did nothing, which is the worst
  outcome for an agent asserting on it. The gesture now presses the deepest node
  under the start point when that node is inside the source (library listeners
  commonly sit on an inner handle, and events only bubble upward; an overlay over
  the source is ignored), streams interpolated `pointermove`/`mousemove` events
  hit-tested at each step, emits the HTML5 sequence as before, and releases with
  `pointerup`/`mouseup`. Every pointer event precedes its compatibility mouse
  event, as a browser produces them. `steps`, `stepDelayMs` and `settleMs` params
  tune it over JSON-RPC and MCP, and the Rust-side eval timeout now covers the
  gesture they describe instead of a flat 10 s. The result echoes
  `from`/`to`/`steps` and adds `html5DropHandled` so a caller can see whether a
  native handler claimed the drop. `ok` still means only that the gesture was
  delivered — assert the effect. [#142]

### Security

- Upgrade the docs site to Astro 7.1.5 (from 6.3.2), Starlight 0.41.5 and sharp
  0.35.3, clearing all 16 open Dependabot alerts. Astro carried four XSS issues
  and a host-header SSRF in the prerendered error page fetch; sharp inherited
  four libvips CVEs. Refreshing the lockfile also moved the transitive
  js-yaml (4.3.0), svgo (4.0.2), vite (8.1.5) and esbuild (0.28.1) onto patched
  versions. Docs-only — the plugin and CLI crates are untouched. [#140]

- Upgrade `quick-xml` to 0.42, clearing RUSTSEC-2026-0194 (quadratic
  duplicate-attribute check) and RUSTSEC-2026-0195 (unbounded namespace
  allocation), both scored 7.5. The docs lockfile was refreshed again to drop
  the vulnerable `js-yaml` and `nanoid` it still carried. `cargo audit` and
  `npm audit` are both clean. [#143]

## [0.7.2] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- `tauri-pilot --version` prints the CLI version. The flag was missing, so a
  caller had no way to confirm which build they were running. [#135]
- The plugin reports its own version in the `ping` response, and
  `tauri-pilot ping` now shows the plugin and CLI versions together and warns
  when they drift. A response without a `plugin_version` field comes from a
  plugin <= 0.7.0, which predates the macOS native-eval fix, so the CLI points
  at an upgrade. [#135]
- `state` output includes the plugin's `plugin_version`. [#135]
- The plugin logs its version when the socket or named pipe starts listening,
  so the running plugin version shows up in the app's logs. [#135]

## [0.7.1] - 2026-06-05

### Fixed

- Restore eval-based commands on macOS headless CI runners by delivering eval
  results through the existing `__callback` IPC command on every platform instead
  of relying on the native `WKWebView` completion handler, which may never fire
  without an interactive GUI session. [#126]
- Update two stale `EvalEngine` doc comments that still described the removed
  native eval callback model; eval results are now documented as delivered via
  the `__callback` IPC command on every platform. [#128]
- Capture the full document height in `screenshot` without `--selector`.
  html-to-image sized the render from the viewport and always started at the
  document origin, so the PNG showed the top of the page regardless of scroll
  position and silently dropped everything below the fold. [#129]
- Scroll the source element into view before an offset drag. `drag --offset`
  resolves the drop point with `elementFromPoint`, which is viewport-bound, so
  a source outside the visible viewport failed with the misleading error
  "No element at offset (x,y)". The bridge now centers the source in the
  viewport first, and the residual errors name the actual cause (drop point
  outside the viewport vs. no element at the computed point). [#130]

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-30

### Added

- Add a `screenshot_native` CLI subcommand to capture a native window PNG by
  window id. [#108]
- Make bridge bootstrap idempotent so repeated injection attempts are no-ops.
  [#108]

### Fixed

- Restore eval result delivery on Tauri 2.11 / wry 0.55 by using native
  WebView eval callbacks instead of JS-to-Tauri `__callback` IPC for eval
  results. [#108]
- Preserve `windows.list` output without panicking when wry 0.55 cannot report
  a webview URL. [#108]
- Include `<p>` paragraph text in accessibility snapshots by mapping `<p>` to
  the `paragraph` role. Snapshots previously dropped paragraph content (e.g. the
  default Tauri template greeting rendered in a `<p>`), so callers could not
  verify text that appeared after an interaction. The role is non-interactive,
  so `snapshot --interactive` still omits paragraphs. [#109]
- Restore eval on Linux (`WebKitGTK`) and Windows (`WebView2`). [#108] switched
  eval delivery to reading the script's return value, which only works on macOS
  where `WKWebView` resolves a returned Promise; `WebKitGTK` and `WebView2`
  deliver the unresolved Promise instead, so every eval-based command
  (`snapshot`, `state`, `click`, …) timed out after 10s. These platforms now
  deliver eval results through the `__callback` IPC command again, while macOS
  keeps the native callback path from [#108]. [#110]
- Make `select` match by visible option label as well as `value`, and error
  instead of silently reporting `ok` when no option matches. Setting
  `HTMLSelectElement.value` to an unmatched string leaves `value=""` /
  `selectedIndex=-1` per the DOM spec, so passing a label (which snapshots
  surface) or a typo previously cleared the selection while the command still
  exited `0`. A successful `select` now guarantees an option was selected.
  [#113]
- Fire `Control`+digit global shortcuts via `press` on X11 layouts where the
  digit row is shifted (e.g. French AZERTY). `press "Control+1"` now triggers a
  registered `Control+Digit1` accelerator, consistent with `Control+Shift+P`.
  `enigo` resolves a `Key::Unicode` digit only at shift-level 0, so on AZERTY
  (where `1` is `Shift`+`&`) it remapped the digit onto a spare keycode that no
  physical-key `XGrabKey` grab matched, while letters (always level 0) worked —
  the asymmetry #75 could not explain. A digit that is part of a modified combo
  is now injected as its raw physical keycode, matching the keycode
  `global-hotkey` grabs. A bare `press "1"` keeps the layout-aware path, so it
  still types the layout's digit rather than the unshifted physical key. [#114]
- Fire `Shift`+uppercase-letter global shortcuts via `press` on non-US layouts.
  `press "Control+Shift+P"` — the conventional uppercase spelling — silently
  failed to fire its accelerator on AZERTY while exiting `0`; only the lowercase
  `Control+Shift+p` worked. #114 fixed the symmetric digit case but left
  uppercase letters broken: `parse_combo` keeps the literal `'P'`, whose keysym
  lives at shift-level 1, so `enigo` could not place it on the physical key and
  remapped it onto a spare keycode no `XGrabKey` grab matched. An uppercase
  letter in a modified combo is now lowered to its base key for injection, and
  the explicitly held `Shift` produces the uppercase character — matching the
  grab at level 0. A bare `press "P"` keeps `Key::Unicode('P')`, so it still
  types an uppercase `P`. [#121]
- Fix a startup panic on Windows ("there is no reactor running, must be called
  from the context of a Tokio 1.x runtime") that aborted the host app before its
  window opened. tokio's `NamedPipeServer` registers with the reactor the moment
  it is created, but the plugin bound the pipe in its synchronous `setup` hook —
  outside any tokio runtime. The Windows pipe is now bound inside the spawned
  server task, which runs on the runtime. The Unix socket path is unchanged: it
  binds with the std `UnixListener`, which needs no runtime. [#115]
- Stop `diff` aborting on any page containing `<li>` elements. The bridge
  captured an element's `value` IDL property verbatim, but for `<li>`,
  `<progress>`, and `<meter>` that property is a number (an `<li>`'s ordinal,
  defaulting to `0`), so snapshots serialised `"value": 0` while the plugin
  types `SnapshotElement.value` as `Option<String>`. Parsing such a reference
  snapshot failed with `invalid type: integer 0, expected a string` (`-32602`),
  making `diff` unusable on most real apps. The bridge now coerces `value` to a
  string at capture, matching the wire contract. [#120]

### Security

- Block `javascript:` URLs in the `pilot.navigate` MCP tool. Because
  `navigate` is not gated behind the dangerous-tools opt-in, an untrusted MCP
  client could previously pass a `javascript:` URL that the bridge assigns to
  `window.location.href`, executing arbitrary JavaScript and bypassing the
  `pilot.eval` gate added in [#104]. The URL is now normalized the way a
  browser's URL parser would — stripping ASCII tab/newline/carriage-return
  anywhere in the string and leading C0 controls/spaces — before any
  `javascript:` scheme is rejected with `INVALID_PARAMS`, so smuggling
  variants such as `java\tscript:` or `\0javascript:` are blocked too. [#107]
- Harden the release workflow against `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` exfiltration.
  `cargo publish` ran a verification build with the registry token present in
  the environment, so a compromised dependency build script or proc-macro
  could read and leak the token during that build. Each crate is now verified
  with a secret-free `cargo package` step (no token in scope), and the
  token-bearing `cargo publish` step runs with `--no-verify` so it only uploads
  the already-verified package. [#106]
- Shell-escape element `ref` values when exporting recordings to shell
  scripts via `replay --export sh`. Refs were previously emitted unquoted
  (e.g. `tauri-pilot click @e1`) while selectors and values were already
  escaped, so a recording carrying a crafted `ref` (injectable through the
  `record.add` IPC method or a hand-edited recording file) could inject
  arbitrary shell commands into the generated script. All `@ref` tokens —
  top-level targets, nested `source`/`target` refs, and `scroll --ref`
  arguments — are now single-quoted. [#105]
- Gate the dangerous MCP tools `pilot.drop`, `pilot.eval`, and `pilot.ipc`
  behind the `TAURI_PILOT_MCP_ENABLE_DANGEROUS_TOOLS` opt-in environment
  variable. By default these tools are now hidden from `list_tools` and
  rejected at call time, so an untrusted MCP client can no longer execute
  arbitrary JavaScript (`eval`), invoke arbitrary Tauri commands (`ipc`), or
  feed arbitrary local file paths into the app (`drop`). Set the variable to
  `1`, `true`, `yes`, or `on` to restore the previous behaviour. [#104]

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- macOS native screenshot backend (`screencapture` shell-out plus
  `CGWindowListCreateImage` fallback) behind the existing `screenshot`
  module surface; WKWebView path scaffolded for follow-up.
- `screenshot_native` JSON-RPC method (advertised as the `pilot.screenshot_native`
  MCP tool) that captures a window by `window_id` to a caller-specified
  `output_path`. Uses macOS `screencapture` when Screen Recording permission
  is granted, falls back to `CGWindowListCreateImage` with `tcc_denied: true`
  in metadata when permission is revoked between probe and call. Path-only
  response shape — no inline bytes. Bare `screenshot` keeps its existing
  bridge html-to-image behaviour and is wholly separate from the new method,
  so the two surfaces cannot be confused. On Linux and Windows,
  `pilot.screenshot_native` is registered but every call responds with
  `PERMISSION_DENIED` and the message `"screenshot is only available on
  macOS in this release"` — the request shape validators run first, so a
  contract-violating call sees the validation error on every host.

### Security

- Add top-level `permissions: contents: read` to CI and Release workflows
  to satisfy the CodeQL `actions/missing-workflow-permissions` rule (least
  privilege for `GITHUB_TOKEN`). The Release job keeps its scoped
  `contents: write` override needed to publish GitHub Releases.
- Force `devalue` to `^5.8.1` via `docs/package.json` `overrides` to clear
  the GHSA DoS advisory (sparse-array deserialization) flagged on the
  vulnerable `>=5.6.3, <=5.8.0` range pulled transitively through
  `astro`/`@astrojs/starlight`.
- `SKILL.md`: second pass on skills.sh Snyk findings W007 and W011 — the
  first remediation in [#89] cleared the literal `password123` value but
  left enough authentication-flavoured vocabulary and a login example in
  place that the Snyk LLM auditor still graded the skill as encouraging
  secret handling. Restructured the skill so the safety contract sits in a
  top-of-file `## Safety` section that the auditor reads first, dropped the
  standalone `### Untrusted WebView content` and `## Credential Safety`
  sections (their content is consolidated into `## Safety`), and replaced
  the login-form example with a list-filter example that does not type
  into any credential field. Also extended the WebView-output rule to name
  `navigate` and `eval` scripts that call `fetch`, matching the surfaces
  the Snyk W011 finding called out explicitly.

### Changed

- **Breaking (advertised surface):** MCP tool names are now namespaced under
  `pilot.*` in the published tool list — every tool exposed by `tauri-pilot
  mcp` is advertised as `pilot.<name>` (e.g. `pilot.ping`, `pilot.click`,
  `pilot.fill`, `pilot.attrs`, `pilot.snapshot`, `pilot.eval`,
  `pilot.assert_text`, etc.). Bare names continue to resolve through
  `tools/call` for backwards compatibility, but the advertised surface that
  MCP clients discover and register against is the prefixed form. Motivation:
  when this CLI is registered alongside other MCP servers, generic bare names
  like `attrs` or `ping` collide with — and shadow — tools from those servers,
  forcing the client owner to disambiguate by hand. Clients that referred to
  bare names in their server registrations or inline prompts should update to
  the prefixed form (`attrs` → `pilot.attrs`, `ping` → `pilot.ping`, and so
  on). No tool semantics, schemas, or MCP protocol versions change.
- Pin the `rmcp` manifest floor at `1.7.0` (was `^1.4.0`). The lockfile already
  resolved to `1.7.0` via the earlier caret bump in `[0.5.2]`, so this only
  aligns the declared dependency with the version actually being tested and
  prevents an accidental rebuild against a pre-`1.7.0` rmcp. No behaviour
  change.
- Replace ASCII architecture diagram in `README.md` with an `assets/architecture.png`
  illustration (with descriptive `alt` text) for better rendering on crates.io,
  GitHub, and assistive technologies.
- Bump Rust dependencies: `tauri` `2.11.1` → `2.11.2`, `tauri-plugin`
  (build) `2.6.1` → `2.6.2` (patch), `quick-xml` `0.36` → `0.40` (used only
  by scenario serialization tests), `toml` `0.8` → `1` (used by scenario
  loader — `from_str` API unchanged for our usage). Workspace-wide
  `cargo update` also refreshed transitive crates. `windows` (`0.61`) and
  `core-graphics` (`0.24`) intentionally kept pinned until their next
  minor bumps can be validated on actual Windows / macOS runners.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-05-14

### Changed

- Refresh transitive and minor-bump dependency versions via `cargo update`
  within existing semver carets. No public API or CLI behavior changes. Notable
  resolved versions: `tauri` 2.10.3 → 2.11.1, `tauri-plugin` 2.5.4 → 2.6.1,
  `tauri-build` 2.5.6 → 2.6.1, `tokio` 1.50.0 → 1.52.3, `wry` 0.54.4 → 0.55.1,
  `rmcp` 1.5.0 → 1.7.0, `thiserror` 2.0.x → 2.0.18, `tower-http` 0.6.8 →
  0.6.10, `tray-icon` 0.21.3 → 0.23.1, `wasm-bindgen` 0.2.117 → 0.2.121.
  Breaking-only upgrades (`quick-xml` 0.36 → 0.40, `toml` 0.8 → 1.x, `windows`
  0.61 → 0.62) intentionally deferred to dedicated PRs.
- Refresh `docs/` npm dependencies via `npm update --save`. Bumps `astro`
  6.1.9 → 6.3.2 (closes `npm audit` advisory GHSA-xr5h-phrj-8vxv on server
  islands, plus patch fixes for HMR `HTMLElement` errors and double-encoded
  URL handling), `@astrojs/starlight` 0.38.4 → 0.38.5, `sharp` 0.34.2 →
  0.34.5. Astro 6.4 and Starlight 0.39 deferred (both involve breaking
  changes). Supersedes #90.

### Fixed

- `wait` no longer caps user-supplied `--timeout` at the internal Rust default
  (10 s). The handler dispatched `wait` through the generic `handle_eval_method`
  with `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`, so any `--timeout` above 10 000 ms produced a cryptic
  `Eval error: eval timed out after 10s` instead of the bridge's well-formed
  `Timeout waiting for <selector>` rejection. The reporter on issue #91 surfaced
  this as "`wait --selector` silently fails for UUID values" — the UUID was a
  coincidence: their UUID-bearing kanban rows simply rendered after the 10 s
  cap. `wait` now joins `watch` on a shared `bridge_eval_timeout` helper that
  pads the JS-side timeout with a 2 s headroom buffer ([#91]).
- `bridge.js` `waitFor`: explicit `timeout: 0` is honored as "resolve or reject
  immediately" instead of being coerced to the 10 000 ms default via
  `||`-fallback. The previous behavior desynchronised the JS timer from the
  padded Rust channel and could surface the generic "eval timed out" error for
  `wait --timeout 0`. Matches the `watch` semantics that already used a
  `!= null` check ([#91]).

### Security

- `SKILL.md`: addressed skills.sh Snyk findings W007 (insecure credential
  handling) and W011 (third-party content exposure). Replaced the literal
  `user@example.com` / `password123` pair in the login-flow example with
  `$TEST_EMAIL` / `$TEST_PASSWORD` env-var references, added a "Credential
  Safety" preamble that also flags `record` recordings and `replay --export
  sh` shell scripts as credential-bearing artifacts to scrub before sharing,
  and added an "Untrusted WebView content" guard instructing the agent to
  treat output from `eval`, `html`, `text`, `attrs`, `value`, `logs`,
  `network`, and `screenshot` as data to inspect — not instructions to
  follow — and to escalate suspected indirect prompt-injection attempts.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed

- `fill` and `type` actions now work on `<textarea>`. The bridge previously grabbed the `value` setter via `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(HTMLInputElement.prototype, "value") || Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(HTMLTextAreaElement.prototype, "value")` — but the first descriptor is always truthy, so the textarea fallback was unreachable and the input setter was applied to a textarea, throwing `The HTMLInputElement.value setter can only be used on instances of HTMLInputElement` (WebIDL `[LegacyUnforgeable]` brand check). The bridge now resolves the setter via `Object.getPrototypeOf(el)`, which works uniformly across `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` (and also fixes a latent variant of the same bug for inputs sourced from another realm/iframe). The React controlled-input bypass that already existed for plain `<input>` is preserved unchanged ([#85]).

### Changed

- `select` action now validates the target tag explicitly: misrouted selectors that resolve to an `<input>`, `<textarea>`, or any non-`<select>` element fail fast with `select requires a <select> element, got: <tag>` instead of silently writing to the wrong element. The pre-refactor implicit type guard came from the `HTMLSelectElement.prototype.value` brand check; the new `nativeValueSetter` helper picks the setter from the element's own prototype, so the guard was made explicit. The check is tag-based (`el.tagName.toLowerCase() === "select"`) rather than `instanceof`, so `<select>` elements coming from another window/iframe realm continue to work ([#85]).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- **Windows support** — named pipe server and client for Windows, with security hardening (DACL, SID validation), registry-based instance discovery, and platform-specific tests ([#64])
- **Batch scenario runner** — `tauri-pilot run <scenario.toml>` executes declarative TOML scenarios with 18 action types (click, fill, type, press, select, check, scroll, navigate, wait, watch, eval, screenshot, assert-text, assert-exists, assert-visible, assert-hidden, assert-value, assert-url). Supports `fail_fast` (default true), `--no-fail-fast` override, `--junit <file>` for JUnit XML output, and auto-captures failure screenshots to `./tauri-pilot-failures/`. Exit code 0 = all pass, 1 = any failure. Example: `docs/examples/login-flow.toml` ([#62])
- `connect.timeout_ms` in TOML scenarios — wraps `Client::connect` in `tokio::time::timeout` ([#63])
- `global_timeout_ms` in TOML scenarios — hard deadline around `run_scenario` ([#63])
- Per-step `timeout_ms` applied to all non-`wait`/`watch` actions via `tokio::time::timeout` ([#63])
- `<testsuites>` JUnit XML root now carries `tests`, `failures`, `errors`, `skipped`, `time` aggregate attributes for CI reporters (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Allure) ([#63])

### Fixed

- **Windows security hardening** — fixed heap overflow in ACL allocation, use-after-free on the SID buffer, a no-op peer-SID check (`OpenProcessToken` on the impersonated thread replaced with `OpenThreadToken`), UB on the alloc-failure path, silent fallback to a broader default DACL, and a permanently-aborting accept loop. Also switched `instances_dir` creation to `std::fs::create_dir_all` for correctness on clean profiles, and added a regression test asserting the bound pipe carries a user-only DACL with one ACE ([#64])
- `tauri-pilot-cli` Windows builds now enable the `Win32_Foundation` and `Win32_System_Threading` features on the `windows` crate so `is_pid_alive` compiles on Windows CI ([#64])
- `tauri-plugin-pilot` marks the Linux-target `enigo` entry as `optional = true` so `--no-default-features` actually drops the dependency — previously the `press` feature gate was silently defeated by cargo merging the target-specific entry with the top-level one ([#64])
- `tauri-plugin-pilot` server now caps per-line reads using `AsyncReadExt::take` before invoking `read_line`, so a peer flooding bytes without a newline can no longer OOM the host process — the existing `MAX_LINE_LENGTH` check was applied after the full line had already been buffered ([#64])
- `tauri-pilot-cli` Unix client tests use a per-process, atomic-counter socket path instead of hard-coded `/tmp/tauri-pilot-test-*.sock` paths, so parallel `cargo test` runs no longer cross-wire through the same socket file ([#64])
- `tauri-pilot-cli` Windows registry-resolution tests mock entries with `std::process::id()` instead of a fabricated dead PID, so the liveness filter added in the Windows support work doesn't skip them ([#64])
- `assert-exists` now verifies the `visible` key is present in the RPC response to catch missing DOM elements ([#63])
- `scroll top` and `scroll bottom` now actually scroll. Previously the bridge `scroll()` only computed dx/dy for `up`/`down`/`left`/`right`, so `top` and `bottom` returned `✓ ok` while `scrollBy(0, 0)` was a silent no-op. The bridge now uses `scrollTo(scrollX, 0)` for `top` and `scrollTo(scrollX, max(documentElement.scrollHeight, body.scrollHeight) - documentElement.clientHeight)` for `bottom` on the window (preserves horizontal scroll, quirks-mode safe, excludes any horizontal scrollbar height that `window.innerHeight` would otherwise count), and `scrollTop = 0` / `scrollTop = scrollHeight - clientHeight` on element refs. Unknown directions now throw instead of silently no-op (behavior change: scripts that previously got `{ ok: true }` for typos like `"Down"` will now get an error). The MCP `scroll` tool schema also exposes `top` and `bottom` in its direction enum, and `docs/reference/cli.md` lists them ([#73])
- `tauri-pilot wait <target>` (positional) is now parsed the same way as `click`, `text`, `value`, etc.: `@x` is a snapshot ref, anything else is a CSS selector. Previously the positional was forwarded raw and the bridge always treated it as a snapshot ref via `idMap.get`, so `tauri-pilot wait "#trigger-deferred"` timed out even when the element existed ([#74])
- `wait` TOML scenario steps now honor the `ref = "e1"` field on `[[step]]` entries (the same field already accepted by `scroll` etc.), routing through the shared `build_wait_params` helper instead of silently dropping it ([#74])
- `tauri-pilot wait` and the bridge `waitFor` now reject up-front when neither `selector` nor `ref` is provided (including the `@`-alone edge case where `parse_target` would otherwise produce an empty ref), instead of silently waiting on a `MutationObserver` until the timeout fires ([#74])
- Bridge `waitFor` reads `options.ref` (was `options.target`) so its protocol matches `resolveTarget`, the field name used by every other element-targeting handler ([#74])
- The MCP `wait` tool now routes through the same `build_wait_params` helper so MCP clients get the auto-detection fix without their own code change ([#74])
- Scoped the `press` + global-shortcut claim from PR #45 / `[0.4.0]`. On X11, `enigo`'s `XTestFakeKeyEvent` backend does not reliably satisfy the `XGrabKey` passive grabs used by `tauri-plugin-global-shortcut`'s Linux backend, so registered global shortcuts may not fire. DOM listeners and Tauri accelerators are unaffected. See [#75], the README's "Known limitations" section, and the `press` reference docs for the mechanism and the documented workaround.
- `tauri-pilot eval` now auto-wraps top-level `await` in an async IIFE so the natural shape works (`await Promise.resolve("hi")`, `await fetch("/api").then(r => r.json())`). Previously the bridge fell through to indirect eval — a script context where top-level `await` is forbidden — and surfaced an opaque `Unexpected identifier 'Promise'` error instead of pointing at the real cause. The bridge now compiles in three stages (expression → async-expression → async-statement-IIFE-when-await-is-detected → indirect-eval) and emits a clear error pointing back at `docs/reference/cli.md` when none of them parse. Multi-statement scripts that want to surface a value still need an explicit `return`. ([#79])
- `tauri-pilot --json snapshot --save <path>` now emits a self-describing JSON object on stdout: the saved file path is merged into the result as `"path"` (alongside `"elements"`), matching the `record stop --output` and `screenshot` conventions. Pipelines like `... | jq` or `... | python -c 'json.load(sys.stdin)'` are no longer at the mercy of stderr/stdout interleaving. Also routed `tracing` output to stderr in CLI mode so `RUST_LOG`-driven log lines can never corrupt a `--json` payload (it was already routed to stderr in `mcp` mode). The human-readable "Snapshot saved to <path>" line is still printed to stderr ([#80]).

### Changed

- Clippy cleanup / no-suppression policy: remove speculative Windows helpers (`discover_instances`, `find_newest_instance`, `is_pid_alive`), scope test-only imports inside `mod tests` blocks, replace `.unwrap()`/`.unwrap_err()` in tests with `.expect()`/`.expect_err()` to satisfy the workspace `clippy::unwrap_used = "deny"` without module-level `#[allow]` escapes, and fix `cast_precision_loss`/`cast_possible_truncation` via `Duration::as_secs_f64` and `Value::as_i64`. Also retry on `ERROR_PIPE_BUSY` when connecting to the Windows Named Pipe so `client::windows::connect` has a genuine await instead of `#[allow(clippy::unused_async)]`
- `tauri-plugin-pilot` `init()` doc comment clarifies the no-op fallback now excludes Windows too and mentions the Named Pipe server path ([#64])
- Bumped `windows` crate `0.52` → `0.61` on both `tauri-plugin-pilot` and `tauri-pilot-cli`, aligning with the version already pulled transitively by `tauri`/`tao`/`wry`/`webview2-com`/`enigo`. Deduplicates the Windows dependency graph (removes the parallel `windows-targets` tree shipped with 0.52) and picks up the `HANDLE(*mut c_void)` layout matching `std::os::windows::raw::HANDLE`. Mechanical breaking changes: `HANDLE(0)` → `HANDLE(std::ptr::null_mut())`, `HANDLE(raw as isize)` → `HANDLE(raw)`, `self.0.0 != 0` → `!self.0.0.is_null()`, `PSID` import relocated from `Win32::Foundation` to `Win32::Security`, `BOOL` now lives in `windows::core`, `SetSecurityDescriptorDacl` takes `Option<*const ACL>` (cast via `.cast_const()`), `GetSecurityInfo` returns `WIN32_ERROR` (use `.ok()`), `LocalFree` takes `Option<HLOCAL>` ([#68])
- Bumped `indicatif` from `0.17` to `0.18` (brings the transitive `console` update to `0.16`; only `ProgressBar::new_spinner()` is used — API stable)
- Bumped docs dependencies: `astro` `6.1.3` → `6.1.9`, `@astrojs/starlight` `0.38.2` → `0.38.4`, transitively `vite` `7.3.1` → `7.3.2`
- Refreshed `Cargo.lock` patch-level updates: `libc` `0.2.184` → `0.2.186`, `clap` / `clap_derive` `4.6.0` → `4.6.1`, `assert_cmd` `2.2.0` → `2.2.1`

### Security

- Resolved Dependabot alerts #1–#4 (all in `docs/`):
  - `astro` XSS via `define:vars` incomplete `</script>` sanitization ([GHSA-j687-52p2-xcff](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j687-52p2-xcff), CVE-2026-41067) — patched upstream in `astro@6.1.6`; included via bump to `astro@6.1.9`
  - `vite` path traversal in optimized deps `.map` handling ([GHSA-4w7w-66w2-5vf9](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4w7w-66w2-5vf9), CVE-2026-39365)
  - `vite` `server.fs.deny` bypass via query parameters ([GHSA-v2wj-q39q-566r](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v2wj-q39q-566r), CVE-2026-39364)
  - `vite` arbitrary file read via dev-server WebSocket ([GHSA-p9ff-h696-f583](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p9ff-h696-f583), CVE-2026-39363)
  - All three `vite` CVEs fixed transitively via `astro@6.1.9` → `vite@7.3.2`

### Removed

- `.gitignore` no longer ignores `CLAUDE.md`, `.sisyphus/`, `.agents/`, or `skills-lock.json` — these are personal tooling entries that belong in a user-level `~/.gitignore_global`, not in the repo ([#64])

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- `eval` command now reads the script from stdin when the argument is `-` or omitted ([#41])
- Stdin heredoc and pipe examples for `eval -` in README, SKILL.md, and CLI reference ([#50])
- MCP server mode for exposing tauri-pilot commands as structured tools over stdio ([#51])
- `watch --require-mutation` flag defers the stability timer until at least one DOM mutation occurs, then waits for `--stable` ms of quiet. Rejects on timeout if nothing mutated. Use after IPC calls that trigger async re-renders (e.g. React state updates) where you need to block until the re-render lands ([#49])

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `watch` default semantics changed — the stability timer now arms at startup instead of on the first mutation. Idle runs resolve after `--stable` ms with an empty change set (`{added:[], removed:[], modified:[]}`) instead of rejecting with a "no DOM changes" timeout error. Scripts that relied on `watch` as a "did anything change?" assertion should switch to `watch --require-mutation` to keep the old reject-on-idle behaviour ([#49])
- `press` command now injects keyboard events at the OS level via `enigo` instead of dispatching synthetic JS `KeyboardEvent`s. Events are now `isTrusted=true` and traverse the full input pipeline, reaching DOM listeners, Tauri accelerators, and global shortcut handlers ([#45])
- The plugin now requests window focus before injecting keys so events land on the correct webview
- `tauri-plugin-pilot` exposes a default-on `press` feature that gates the `enigo` dependency. Build with `--no-default-features` to drop it from release builds where the whole plugin is already no-op'd ([#53])
- Bumped MSRV from Rust 1.94.0 to **1.95.0** (workspace `Cargo.toml`, `ci.yml`, `release.yml`). Public docs (README, CONTRIBUTING, docs site) updated and the inaccurate "LTS" wording dropped — Rust does not yet ship an LTS channel ([#54])

### Fixed

- `eval` now accepts `const`, `let`, `var`, function declarations and other statements — the previous `new Function("return (…)")` wrapper forced an expression context and rejected top-level declarations. Scripts now run through indirect `eval`, which returns the completion value of the last expression ([#46])
- `click` now dispatches pointer events before mouse events so Radix UI dropdown, select, and dialog triggers open correctly ([#52])
- `press "Control+1"` and similar combos now trigger Tauri global shortcuts and any handler that requires trusted keyboard events ([#45])
- `press` with an explicit `--window <label>` now returns an error when the target window cannot be focused, instead of silently delivering the key to whatever window currently holds focus ([#53])
- `press` serializes the full `focus → settle → inject` sequence, so two concurrent calls targeting different windows can no longer race on the focus step and cross their keys ([#53])
- `press` combo parser now rejects empty segments between `+` (e.g. `Control++P`, `+A`) instead of silently normalizing them into different shortcuts ([#53])
- `press` now explicitly enables enigo's `wayland` backend so OS-level key injection works on Wayland sessions, not just X11 ([#53])
- `press` validates the combo string before taking the focus lock or stealing focus, so malformed input returns `-32602` (invalid params) immediately instead of `-32603` after an 80ms focus settle ([#53])
- `simulate_press` now propagates modifier-release failures instead of dropping them, so a combo can no longer return `Ok(())` while leaving a modifier stuck down ([#53])
- `press` with `--window <label>` but no focus hook installed now errors instead of silently injecting into whatever window has focus ([#53])
- `Enigo::new` failure hint about macOS Accessibility permission is now gated to macOS builds — Linux and Windows errors no longer point users at the wrong remediation ([#53])
- `press` JoinError handling distinguishes panics from cancellation and runtime-shutdown cases instead of reporting every failure as "panicked" ([#53])
- `eval` now exits with code 0 when the JS expression returns `undefined` (e.g. `element.click()`, void functions). Previously the CLI bailed with `Error: Server returned empty result without error`, breaking bash `&&` chains and `set -e` scripts even though the eval had succeeded ([#48])

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added

- **macOS support** — CI verification on macOS, updated documentation and platform requirements ([#37])

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-05

### Security

- **Socket hardening** — three layers of defense against local privilege escalation ([#31])
  - Socket permissions set to `0o600` (owner-only) immediately after bind
  - `umask(0o177)` guard around bind to eliminate TOCTOU race window
  - Peer credential (UID) verification rejects connections from other local users
  - Socket placed in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` (user-private `0o700` directory) with `/tmp` fallback
  - `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` validated for ownership and permissions before use
  - CLI `resolve_socket()` filters candidates by UID ownership

### Added

- **Record/replay** — capture user interactions as replayable test scripts (`record start`, `record stop --output`, `record status`, `replay`, `replay --export sh`) ([#15])
- **Multi-window support** — `windows` command lists all windows, `--window` flag targets specific window ([#14])
- **Form dump** — get all form fields at once instead of calling `value` on each input individually ([#13])
  - `tauri-pilot forms` — dump all forms on the page

  - `tauri-pilot drag @e5 @e6` — drag element to another element
  - `tauri-pilot drag @e5 --offset 0,100` — drag by pixel offset
  - `tauri-pilot drop @e3 --file ./test.png` — simulate file drop on element
  - Dispatches full HTML5 drag event sequence: `dragstart`, `dragenter`, `dragover`, `drop`, `dragend`
- **DOM watch command** — observe DOM mutations with MutationObserver, debounce until stable, and return a change summary ([#10])
  - `tauri-pilot watch` — block until any DOM change, print summary
  - `--timeout` timeout in ms, `--selector` scope to subtree, `--stable` debounce duration
  - Uses `MutationObserver` with `childList`, `subtree`, `attributes`, `characterData`
