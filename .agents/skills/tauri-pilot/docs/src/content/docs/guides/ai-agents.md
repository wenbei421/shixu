## Why tauri-pilot for AI agents

No existing tool lets AI agents interact with Tauri app UIs. The gap exists because:

- **Playwright doesn't work** — Playwright drives standalone browser processes (Chromium, Firefox, and its own bundled WebKit build). Tauri embeds the system WebView directly (WebKitGTK on Linux, WebKit on macOS), so there is no browser process for Playwright to attach to.
- **tauri-pilot speaks a protocol optimized for LLM consumption** — the accessibility tree output is text-based, compact, and structured to be read directly by a language model.
- **Refs map to UI elements unambiguously** — `@e3` is a stable handle within a snapshot, removing the need for CSS selectors or XPath expressions.

## The snapshot → interact → verify workflow

The core loop for any AI agent using tauri-pilot is: take a snapshot to discover elements, interact using refs, then verify the result.

```bash
# Step 1: Get the accessibility tree
tauri-pilot snapshot -i

# Output:
# - heading "PR Dashboard" [ref=e1]
# - textbox "Search PRs" [ref=e2] value=""
# - button "Refresh" [ref=e3]
# - list "PR List" [ref=e4]
#   - listitem "fix: resolve memory leak #142" [ref=e5]

# Step 2: Interact using refs
tauri-pilot click @e3

# Step 3: See what changed (instead of re-reading the full tree)
tauri-pilot diff
```

The `diff` command compares the current page with the last snapshot and returns only added, removed, and changed elements. This saves significant tokens — a typical diff after a click is 2-5 lines vs 50-100 for a full re-snapshot.

The `-i` flag filters to interactive elements only, reducing noise in the output. That set includes native controls and unmapped hosts with `draggable="true"`, `contenteditable`, an `onclick` handler, or `tabindex`.

## Structured output with --json

Use the `--json` flag to get machine-parseable output when the agent needs to process responses programmatically.

```bash
tauri-pilot snapshot --json
tauri-pilot text @e1 --json
tauri-pilot url --json
```

JSON output is useful when the agent needs to extract specific values, compare states, or pass data between steps without text parsing.

## Example: Automated UI testing workflow

```bash
# 1. Health check
tauri-pilot ping

# 2. Navigate to a page
tauri-pilot navigate "http://localhost:1420/settings"

# 3. Wait for page load
tauri-pilot wait --selector ".settings-form"

# 4. Snapshot to discover elements
tauri-pilot snapshot -i

# 5. Fill a form
tauri-pilot fill @e2 "new-value"

# 6. Submit
tauri-pilot click @e5

# 7. Verify success
tauri-pilot wait --selector ".success-toast"
tauri-pilot snapshot -i
tauri-pilot assert text @e1 "Settings saved"
tauri-pilot assert url "/settings"
```

## Best practices for snapshot parsing

- **Always take a fresh snapshot before interacting** — refs reset on each snapshot. `@e1` in one snapshot may refer to a different element in the next.
- **Use `diff` instead of re-snapshotting** — after an interaction, `tauri-pilot diff` returns only what changed. This is much cheaper than re-reading the full tree.
- **Use `-i` to filter interactive elements** — this reduces output size and makes the tree easier to parse.
- **Use `-s` to scope to a section** — `tauri-pilot snapshot -s "#sidebar"` limits the tree to a subtree, further reducing noise.
- **Use `wait` before snapshot** — after navigation or interaction, wait for the page to settle before taking a snapshot to avoid acting on stale state.
- **Use `assert` for verification** — `tauri-pilot assert text @e1 "Dashboard"` returns exit 0 on match, exit 1 on mismatch. This replaces the three-step `text @e1` → parse → compare pattern, saving a round-trip and token parsing.
- **Save snapshots for multi-step workflows** — `tauri-pilot snapshot --save before.snap` then `tauri-pilot diff --ref before.snap` lets you compare against any point in time.
- **Record agent workflows for regression testing** — wrap your interaction sequence in `record start` / `record stop --output test.json` to capture actions as a replayable script. Use `replay test.json` to re-run the same sequence, or `replay test.json --export sh` to generate a standalone shell script.

```bash
# Assert examples — one-step verification
tauri-pilot assert text @e1 "Dashboard"           # exact text match
tauri-pilot assert visible @e3                     # element is visible
tauri-pilot assert value @e2 "workspace"           # input value
tauri-pilot assert count ".list-item" 5            # element count
tauri-pilot assert contains @e1 "error"            # partial text match
tauri-pilot assert url "/dashboard"                # URL substring

# Scoped snapshot example
tauri-pilot snapshot -i -s "#main-content"
```

## Multi-window apps

For Tauri apps with multiple windows, use `tauri-pilot windows` to discover available windows and `--window <label>` to target a specific one:

```bash
# List all windows
tauri-pilot windows
# main      http://localhost:1420/        My App
# settings  http://localhost:1420/settings Settings

# Target a specific window
tauri-pilot --window settings snapshot -i
tauri-pilot --window settings fill @e2 "new-value"

# Or set via environment variable
export TAURI_PILOT_WINDOW=settings
tauri-pilot snapshot -i
```

Without `--window`, all commands target the `main` window (or the first available). The window flag works with every command including `--follow` mode and `ipc`.

## Integration with Claude Code

tauri-pilot is designed to be used as a tool by Claude Code directly:

- Claude Code can read the snapshot output directly — it is an accessibility tree, the same representation Claude Code uses internally for UI reasoning.
- The ref system (`@e1`) maps directly to how Claude Code thinks about UI elements as discrete, addressable targets.
- Combine with `--json` for structured data extraction when the agent needs to compare values or branch on state.

A typical Claude Code session using tauri-pilot looks like this:

```bash
# Claude Code calls these as shell commands during a task
tauri-pilot ping                          # verify the app is running
tauri-pilot snapshot -i                   # discover what's on screen
tauri-pilot fill @e2 "search query"       # interact
tauri-pilot click @e3                     # submit
tauri-pilot wait --selector ".results"    # wait for response
tauri-pilot diff                          # see what changed (token-efficient)
tauri-pilot snapshot -i                   # refresh refs
tauri-pilot assert text @e1 "Results"     # verify in one step
```

No custom integration code is needed — tauri-pilot is a CLI that Claude Code can invoke directly.

## MCP Server

Agents with native Model Context Protocol support can use tauri-pilot as a stdio
MCP server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tauri-pilot": {
      "command": "tauri-pilot",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

The MCP server exposes the same app-facing commands as structured tools,
namespaced under `pilot.*`: `pilot.snapshot`, `pilot.click`, `pilot.fill`,
`pilot.logs`, `pilot.network`, `pilot.eval`, `pilot.ipc`, `pilot.assert_*`, and
more. `tools/list` advertises the prefixed names; bare names (e.g. `snapshot`)
still resolve via `tools/call` for backwards compatibility. Tool calls return
structured JSON content, so agents do not need to parse terminal output.

Use global flags before `mcp` when an agent should target a specific app socket or
window:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tauri-pilot": {
      "command": "tauri-pilot",
      "args": ["--socket", "/tmp/tauri-pilot-myapp.sock", "--window", "main", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```
